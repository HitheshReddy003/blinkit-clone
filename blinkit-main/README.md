## Challanges
Every journey comes with its challenges, and mine was no different. I was highly active and completed my tasks on time. However, due to numerous functionalities, I often found it confusing to navigate through others' code, especially while accessing local storage for different parts of the project.

I faced significant difficulty in finding the correct API to fetch the exact geographical location.

Another challenge was merging all the files in the proper sequence. Some pages had the same name, which caused the site to redirect incorrectly. It was difficult to identify and rename those files correctly.

To maintain consistency, I placed the navbar and footer in a separate folder and imported them into every file. This method was new to me, and I struggled during its implementation.

Managing CSS was another hurdle. When merging CSS files for pages worked on by multiple members, I encountered conflicts due to overlapping class and tag names.
